One student’s love of sneakers paid off in a big way, after his gym teacher straight up gave him a pair of OG AJ1’s in the iconic “Chicago” colorway, a pair that used to belong to his son: “Gym teacher noticed my love for shoes this year and gave me his son’s Chicago 1’s”. Submitted by Reddit user mrcrano, here we see the well-aged pair in question. Let’s just hope the teacher’s son OK’d the gift!</p>
